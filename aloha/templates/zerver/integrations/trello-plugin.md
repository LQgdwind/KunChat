This legacy integration for Trello works by running a script that
communicates with the Trello API in a cron job. We recommend
[the new Trello webhook integration](./trello) (which will
eventually replace this entirely). Please
[report any issues](https://github.com/aloha/aloha/issues/new)
which cause you to prefer this integration over the webhook
integration.

Next, download a copy of
[trello-to-aloha](https://github.com/aloha/trello-to-aloha)
and follow the instructions in `README.md`.
